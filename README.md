# Birthday-Wishes-To-Gf
This project is a personalized birthday website created to celebrate my girlfriend’s special day in a unique and memorable way. Instead of a traditional card or message, I wanted to design something interactive, heartfelt, and creative that reflects both my technical skills and the emotions behind the occasion.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on smooth design, lively effects, and a user‑friendly layout. Every section is carefully customized to deliver a surprise that feels personal and engaging. From animated greetings to interactive elements, the site is designed to capture the joy of a birthday celebration while showcasing how technology can be used to express love and creativity.

✨ Key Features
💌 Custom Birthday Message: A heartfelt note displayed with elegant typography and styling.

🎉 Interactive Animations: Fun effects like confetti, balloons, or glowing text to create a festive mood.

📸 Photo Sections: Optional placeholders for personal images or memories.

💖 Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices, ensuring the surprise can be enjoyed anywhere.

🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is not only to celebrate a birthday but also to demonstrate how web development can be used for personal storytelling. It’s a reminder that code isn’t just functional — it can be emotional, expressive, and deeply personal.

🌐 Inspiration
This website reflects my passion for blending technical skill with emotional storytelling. It’s a small but meaningful project that shows how creativity and coding can come together to make someone feel truly special.
